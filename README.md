## Overview

This is a full-stack application that allows the user to search for a national park or other national point of interest that they would be most interested in visiting, given a number of different variables that the user supplies. Proximity, outdoor interests, and other factors will be analyzed to inform the user of places they would most likely be interested in visiting. 

The application is built with **Node** and **Express** on the server, and uses a **SQL** database managed by **PostgreSQL**. It also utilizes the **Sequelize** library, which allows seamless integration with the API.

The frontend is built with **Vue** and **Vuex**.

The API also utilizes data from the National Park Service API (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm)

## Testing
